# Blinkit Clone

> A polished Flutter front-end clone of Blinkit (grocery delivery app). This repository contains a production-ready mobile UI built with Flutter. The project is intended as a polished portfolio piece demonstrating mobile UI/UX, state management, and e-commerce flows.

## Key Features

* Clean, responsive Flutter UI inspired by Blinkit.
* Product listing, category browsing, and product details UI.
* Cart UI with item increment/decrement and subtotal calculation.
* Checkout flow UI (address selection and payment placeholder).
* Search and filter UI for quick product discovery.
* Modular folder structure for easy scaling and customization.

> ⚠️ This repository contains the Flutter front-end only. Backend/API and real payments are not included by default (see **Integrations** below).

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
* **State management:** (You can list Provider / Riverpod / GetX / Bloc if used)
* **Local storage / persistence:** (e.g., SharedPreferences / Hive — update if applicable)
* **Assets & icons:** Local `assets/` folder (images, fonts)

* A device or emulator

## Configuration & Integrations

If you want real data or authentication, consider integrating one of the following backends:

* **Firebase** — Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Functions for prototyping.
* **REST API** — Connect to any REST backend (Node.js/Express, Django/DRF, Spring Boot).
* **GraphQL** — For more complex data needs and flexible queries.

Create a `lib/services/api_service.dart` and keep any API keys or secrets out of the repo (use environment variables or a `.env` file and `flutter_dotenv`).

## Tests

Add unit and widget tests in the `/test` folder. Example:

```bash
flutter test
```

## Roadmap (suggested enhancements)

* Connect to a backend and add authentication (Firebase or custom).
* Add order history and user profiles.
* Implement push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging).
* Add search suggestions and advanced filtering.
* Add localization (i18n) and theming support.

## Tips to make README even better

* Add a short GIF showing the main app flow (home → product → cart → checkout).
* Replace placeholders with real screenshots from `/assets`.
* Add CI badges (GitHub Actions) for builds and tests.
* Add `releases` or `changelog.md` for versioning notes.
